# README

This WebApp is a course review website for Mount Holyoke College Students. 
The current version has the following features: 

 - user can rate a course using the form 
 - user can see the previous ratings provided by others 

Future Goals that we are planning to do: 

- Implement User Authentication 
- Let the user add a course if course doesnt exist in the available courses 
- Implement a search button 
- Improving the Front-End of the webapp.
